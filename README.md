# spelunky-bot
It's a bot that plays Spelunky! If it's running, it'll be on twitch.tv/Alt703.  
It's inspired by twitch.tv/purpletofucrate, written in Python, and plays an entirely vanilla version of Spelunky.  
To use it, just do `pip install keyboard` or grab it from https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/, and then run `spelunkybot.py`.  
You'll have to enter the PID of your Spelunky process so it can read the game's memory.  

I plan to make this into a neural network soon-ish, but it's just a super basic bot at the moment.
